# Classes
In this section, we discuss classes, constructor, data members, methods, dunder methods, and operator overloading. The Student and CreditCard class serve as examples for the basics of classes, methods, and the str operator. The Vending Machine class is for you to implement for practice. (The bank account class is also provided for extra practice) The Complex Number class serves as an example for operator overloading. The Fraction class is for you to implement for practice.
