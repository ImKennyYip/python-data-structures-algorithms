# [Python Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKe36F30Y4bcRomKi02sP9NR27KnBqCK)

Welcome to my Python Data Structures and Algorithms course! In this course, I will teach you all you need to know about Python Data Structures and Algorithms. I will walk you through each concept step-by-step, implement all data structures and algorithms, and provide practice problems and exams. By the time you have completed this course, you will also have seen at least 40 leetcode easy-med problems. ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) is a resource used for practicing problems asked during technical interviews)
